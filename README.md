# k-cms-admin
## An Admin Panel for the K-CMS Back End

## Backgorund
This project is a Vue application that allows a user to update their page. This project uses Vue as its framework. The admin panel allows a user to create, review, update and delete (CRUD) users, web pages and blog posts. Currently, the admin panel is in active development, so few features work yet.

This admin panel is designed to be easy to use and navigate. It will feature a drag and drop web builder interface that allows a user to easily and quickly build and update pages. This provides web designers easy control over basic pages.
